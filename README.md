# Sci-Fi-LED-Helmet
OUTDATED

A futuristic helmet with LED matricies that I'm building and planning to use for future cosplay. It uses ESP32 and 2 15x8 LED matricies to display different facial expressions and words. The matricies are controlled remotely via bluetooth and can change colour as well as display custom sentences.

Below you see outdated screenshots. The image at the very bottom shows the latest iteration of the helmet with the HUB75 LEDs
