# Sci-Fi-LED-Helmet
A futuristic helmet with LED matricies that I'm building and planning to use for future cosplay. It uses ESP32 and 2 15x8 LED matricies to display different facial expressions and words. The matricies are controlled remotely via bluetooth and can change colour as well as display custom sentences.
